     <h1>The Mechanical</h1>

    <p>Â </p>
    <p>I enjoyed this book a lot. It's slow moving at times with the author taking
      his time with conversations and descriptions of them. The premise is very
      interesting, but I'm sad that it wasn't elaborated more deeply - e.g. the
      history and development of the clakker technology with Huygens and how
      Spinoza comes into the picture. Maybe the author saves it for the next
      two parts of the book.</p>
    <p>Language can be intimidating at first for non-native english speakers
      - author uses wide range of vocabulary. Fortunately it gets better after
      a while as reader adjusts.</p>
